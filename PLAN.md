# PLAN

## Validate credentials are not in git

## Validate a hacker cannot get rid of authentication by modifying the client

## Separate data from code

## Protect data/API

- **If protecting S3/API:**
  - Add Cognito authorizer to API Gateway.
  - Update S3 bucket policy to allow only authenticated users if needed.
- **Document all changes in IaC and update README.**

## Internationalisation

## Make tests independent of text content

## Make individual answers clickable

## Lógica I Exams as individual sections

## Allow anonimous access

## Restrict who can access authenticated?

## Preserve data in the server
